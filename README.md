This exercise asked us to produce a simple day planner for workday hours.
I used bootstrap to create the columns on the page to display the hour/text/save button.
It took me a minute to figure out that HTML works on military time, so it took several edits to get my HTML correct.
I used a moment function to produce the date on the page as well as set the time for the colors to change on the calendar.
Getting the function for the color change was the hardest part, I found a good example on stack overflow and used that to help guide me.
After several changes to the function, and having to change the time on my laptop to test it, I finally got the colors to line up with the time correctly.
I continued to struggle with the present time, because I kept making it an absolute statement "===" rather than an open one "==".
Once I figured that out, it happened for me.
